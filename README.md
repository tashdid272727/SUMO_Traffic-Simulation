# SUMO_Traffic-Simulation
"Simulation of Urban MObility" (SUMO) is an open source, highly portable, microscopic and continuous traffic simulation package designed to handle large networks. It allows for intermodal simulation including pedestrians and comes with a large set of tools for scenario creation.

Performed Traffic Simulation in a 7x7 grid network consisting of residential and commercial zones. The purpose of the project was to simulate the traffic flow between a residential and commercial zone. Therefore, parameters such as, maximum que, no. of traffic on road, maximum and average speed of vehicle and the location of congestion was found out by performing the simulation.
