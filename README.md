# SUMO_Traffic-Simulation
The network shown above shows two zones; Area within ABCD columns are residential and EFGH is a commercial zone. Each block is &lt;50+0.5* last two digits of your roll> meter in XX direction but &lt;100+ last two digits of your roll> meter in YY direction. Gap between D and E is 2000m. Each block is surrounded by 2 lane roads (one on each side) but roads along 1, 3 and 5 are 4 lane (2 lane each side). Zone AB23 and AB56 are origin zones while Zone GH23 and GH56 are destination zone. You are free to assign any number of reasonable traffic between AB23-GH23, AB23-GH56, AB56-GH23, AB56-GH56 or assign random trips. Perform simulation and report: Maximum que at D1, D4, D7 Number of traffic on road DE1, DE4 and DE7 Maximum and avg. speed of vehicle Any notable congestion location and suggestion to improve the network
